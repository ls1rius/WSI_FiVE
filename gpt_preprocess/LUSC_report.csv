Sections show two separate tumors composed of poorly differentiated. carcinoma with focal suggestion of squamous differentiation. The larger. tumor is found superiorly in the lower lobe. This tumor invades and. puckers the overlying pleura, but chest wall invasion and invasion into. the upper lobe are not identified. However, a second tumor is identified. more centrally in the upper lobe. This is separate from the RLL tumor,. measures 3 cm in greatest dimension, and shows similar histology to that. of the RLL tumor. The tumor demonstrates extensive vascular invasion,. including invasion of some larger vessels, and several pulmonary infarcts. are noted in the upper lobe. Multiple peribronchial lymph nodes are. involved by tumor, including by direct invasion of the RUL tumor. By. immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells show strong cytoplasmic staining. for. 5/6, focal moderate staining for high and low molecular weight. cytokeratin, and moderate to strong nuclear staining for p63. The tumor. cells are negative for cytokeratin 7 and 20, and TTF-1. The morphological. and immunohistochemical features are consistent with poorly. differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Given the morphologic. similarities between the RUL and RLL tumors and the extent of vascular. invasion, the RUL tumor is strongly favored to represent a metastasis. from the RLL tumor. The pathologic stage is therefore assessed to be. pT2N1M1. 3 of 10. CLINICAL HISTORY. LUNG CA. GROSS DESCRIPTION. 1. The specimen labeled with the patient's name and as ""Lymph-Node: ST9.

Page: 2 of 6. COMMENT. This case was initially signed out as a provisional report on. and has been amended to include results of immunohistochemical. stains. The diagnoses have not changed from the original report. The lymph nodes resected in the case (specimen 1-8) show diffuse. involvement with well-formed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Occasional mixed dust nodules with central hyalinization and focal. central necrosis are also present. Special stains for fungal elements. and acid-fast organisms are negative. There is no evidence of metastatic. carcinoma in any of the lymph nodes examined. :ctions of the tumor in specimen 8 show predominately moderately. differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (90%) with a small component. (10%) of a poorly differentiated spindle cell carcinoma that demonstrates. shows multiple mitoses and severe cytologic atypia. There is no. malignant cartilage, bone, or skeletal muscle identified in the spindle. cell component. Immunohistochemistry shows the squamous cell component. of the tumor to be positive for multiple cytokeratins (HMWK, CK5/6,. E1/AE3) and p63. The spindled component shows weak positive staining. for CK5/6 and p63, with very focal positive staining for CK7. The EGFR. shows strong membranous staining in approximately 90% of both the. moderately differentiated. component and the spindled component. Both. components are negative for p53 and TTF-1. The findings are consistent. with a pleomorphic carcinoma composed of predominantly squamous cell. carcinoma (moderately differentiated, 90%) and pleomorphic spindle-cell. carcinoma (poorly differentiated, 10%), pT2NO. The residual lung parenchyma in both specimen 1 (""wedge resection right. middle lobe"") and specimen 8 (""right lower lobe"") shows patchy. interstitial fibrosis that appears accentuated in a subpleural. distribution, with focal areas of architectural remodeling and cyst. formation (microscopic honeycomb change) There is mild chronic. interstitial inflammation associated with areas of fibrosis. Fibroblastic. foci are readily identified. The blood vessels show focal fibrointimal. thickening, likely secondary to the background inflammatory process, but. no diagnostic evidence of active vasculitis. Granulomas are noted within. an intraparenchymal lymph node (specimen 1), but are not identified in. the lung parenchyma itself. .ne overall findings in the lung tissue are in keeping with pulmonary. Page: 3 of 6. fibrosis of UIP pattern. However, the simultaneous presence of numerous. non-necrotizing granulomas within the lymph nodes is not typical of UIP,. and may indicate a second superimposed process, the differential. diagnosis of which is broad but which could include infections, drug. reactions, and sarcoidosis. Correlation with clinical and microbiologic. findings is recommended. ROSS DESCRIPTION.

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy/m right thoracotomy. ADDENDUM. Histologic sections of the parts 2 (portion of 6th rib) and part 3 (portion of 5th rib) demonstrate. unremarkable bone and bone marrow. ADDENDUM. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization studies performed on the squamous cell carcinoma shows. a ratio of EGFR gene to the centromere of dhromosome 7 of 1.02 indicating no EGFR. amplification in the targeted region. The rate of hyperploidy for the centromere of. chromosome 7 was 48.0% of the analyzed cells. The signal to nucleus ratio (SNR) for the. EGFR gene was 2.3. Interpretation guidelines for EGFR Gene Copy Number by FISH: Ratio of EGFR to the centromere of chromosome 7: Less than 2.0: No EGFR amplification. Greater than 2.0: EGFR amplification. Hyperploidy: Greater than two centromere copies/cell. SNR: The average number of EGFR signals per analyzed cell within the targeted region. Clinical studies show high EGFR gene copy number by FISH analysis to be associated with. favorable. clinical benefit (clinical response, stable disease, time to progression, and survival). in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitors.

COMMENT: The pathologic staging of this tumor is challenging. We are aware of the patient's CT guided FNA of the right upper lobe. that was positive for non-small cell carcinoma, favor squamous cell carcinoma. It is uncertain. whether tumor in the current specimen and tumor in the right upper lobe represent two independent primaries or a. metastases. If these two tumors represent an independent primaries then the current tumor would be staged as T3NO. If the tumor in the right upper lobe represents a metastasis of the tumor in the left upper lobe then the stage would be. T3 NO M1a. Clinical correlation is suggested.",TCGA-34-8455,LUSC

The following template summarizes the findings in this. case: Histologic type: Both of the mass lesions consist of poorly. differentiated non-small cell carcinoma. There are areas that it is. favored have squamous differentiation, as well as less frequent. foci suggestive of glandular differentiation (adenocarcinoma). Although not entirely identical, the two lesions look similar. Histologic grade: Poorly differentiated. Primary tumor (pT) These two lesions are grossly 2.6 cm and 4 cm. in greatest dimension. The 2.6 cm in diameter lesion has visceral. pleural invasion, with the larger lesion extending very. peripherally but without definite visceral pleural invasion. Although it is difficult to definitely distinguish between. synchronous primaries and the two masses being part of the same. process, given the similarities in appearance, based on the new. guidelines, two nodules of similar histology in the same lobe.

Submitted fresh for tissue procurement labeled ""left. upper lobe"" is a lobe of lung tissue which has been. amputated at the level of its principle bronchus and blood vessels. The bronchial profiles that are present consists of three bronchi,. each approximately 8 to 9 mm across. They are grossly unremarkable. Some vascular stumps are present at the point of amputation as well. There is some anthracotic tissue present which may represent some. hilar lymph nodes. The visceral pleural surface of the lobe is. intact although there is a small area of adhesion and thickening. overlying an obviously large intraparenchymal tumor mass. The. remainder of the parenchyma is anthracotic without focal lesion. The lung was serially sectioned and this reveals a very large tumor. mass present in the center of the lobe which has a extensively. necrotic center. The tumor mass measures maximally 6 cm. across. There is a rim of granular brown black tumor tissue present which. appears to extend to the visceral pleural surface. The center of the. tumor is necrotic with a creamy yellowish red appearance.

Lung (right lower lobe). lobectomy: Poorly differentiated large cell carcinoma with squamoid features, 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, predominantly endobronchial, but with. pulmonary parenchymal invasion (see comment). Closest inked pleural margin is negative for malignancy. Bronchus and blood vessels at surgical margin negative for malignancy; negative for lymphovascular invasion.

Lung (right middle lobe), wedge biopsy: Benign pulmonary parenchyma with pleural adhesions. COMMENTS: The endobronchial tumor in the right lower lobe (block B2) is stained with a battery of immunohistochemical stains to better categorize the nature of the. tumor. The tumor cells are strongly reactive with high molecular weight cytokeratin (SK) and greater than 70% of the tumor cell nuclei are positive with. p63. CD56. marks about 5-10% of the tumor cell cytoplasm and cytokeratin 5/6 marks approximately 20-30% of the tumor cells. Cytokeratin 7 and thyroid. transcription. factor-1 (TTF-1) are negative. These stains support a diagnosis of poorly differentiated squamous carcinoma. The mildly positive CD56. indicates a small component of a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The positive control slides for CK7. TTF-1, CD56, p63, and SK are appropriate. The. positive control for CK5/6 is assigned to case. CLINICAL INFORMATION. CLINICAL HISTORY: Preoperative Diagnosis: Right lower lobe lung cancer.

Lymph nodes, level 4R, excision: Negative for malignancy, two small nodes. COMMENTS: Histologic sections demonstrate a poorly differentiated. malignancy, with extensive necrosis. Focally, convincing. squamous differentiation is noted. No gland formation is. appreciated. The malignancy focally extends to immediately. beneath the surface of the visceral pleura. Areas of. adhesion between visceral and parietal pleura are noted, and. some portions of parietal pleura are present for evaluation. These are uninvolved by the malignancy, as is the resected. segment of rib. The histologic appearance of localized squamous. differentiation corresponds to changes noted in a prior fine. needle aspiration biopsy,. No history of. intervening treatment is received, nowever, the focally. extensive necrosis in the malignancy could be the result of. intervening treatment, and clinical correlation is. suggested. Bronchial and vascular margins are free of. malignancy grossly and microscopically as are lymph nodes. There is, however, involvement of a bronchus at the stapled. margin by both in situ, and focally invasive, carcinoma. Clinical correlation is suggested. The granuloma present in one node appears inactive, and. special stains for microorganisms will not be performed a. this time, unless requested. Sections have also been reviewed by Dr. who is in. agreement. CLINICAL HISTORY: Preoperative Diagnosis: year old female with right lung. cancer.

This report is issued to reflect a change in the final diagnosis section part D to correct the total number of lymph nodes to 18 which includes the. two positive lymph nodes in the lobectomy specimen. The correction does not modify the previous diagnostic information. DIAGNOSIS. DIAGNOSIS: A. Level 10 lymph nodes: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in one of five lymph nodes (1/5). B. Level 4 lymph nodes: Five benign hyperplastic regional lymph nodes (0/5). C. Level 11 lymph nodes: Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in one of five lymph nodes (1/5). D. Right upper lung lobectomy: Carcinoma. Tumor Characteristics: 1. Histologic type: Squamous cell carcinoma. 2. Histologic grade: Moderately to poorly differentiated (G2-3). 3. Tumor site: Two masses are present, one of which is central and the other which is peripheral. 4. Tumor focality: Multifocal, see comment. 5. Tumor size: Largest mass 2.8 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm, smaller mass 2.6 x 2.5 x 2.0 cm. 6. Visceral pleural invasion: Not identified. 7. Lymphovascular space invasion: Present. 8. Tumor extension: Tumor confined to lung. 9. Treatment effect: Not identified. Surgical Margin Status: 1. Tumor distance from bronchial margin: 0.5 cm. 2. Tumor distance from parenchymal (stapled) margin: 3.5 cm. 3. Tumor distance from pleural surface: Approximately 0.1 cm. Lymph Node Status: 1. Total number of lymph nodes received (utilizing all specimens submitted): 18. 2. Total number of lymph nodes containing metastatic carcinoma: 4 (4/18). Other: 1. Other significant findings: None. 2. pTNM stage: pT1b, N1. E. Level 7 lymph node: Solitary benign hyperplastic lymph node (0/1). COMMENTS: The two masses in the lung appear microscopically essentially identical and given the presence of lymphovascular space invasion it is favored that rather. than these being metachronous carcinomas instead one represents lymphovascular space or intraparenchymal metastasis.

There. are multiple linear staple lines in the hilar area and one at the. apex. Bronchial resection margin is taken for frozen section. examination (FSA1). Vessel resection margins in this area are submitted in block 4. Two. centimeters from the bronchial resection margin, there is a 3.1 x. 2.- x 1.5 cm firm tan, partially necrotic tumor mass of the. anteromedial segment, which encases and apparently obstructs the. bronchus, as distal bronchi exude white pus-like material. A tumor. appears to extend up to the large vessel wall, which is not. occluded, and to involve adjacent peribronchial lymph node (blocks. 5-7) . Overlying pleura in this area is not grossly involved, but. ragged and with staple lines impeding evaluation (block 8). Three. black peribronchial lymph nodes contiguous with the mass appear. partially involved by tumor and range from 0.6 to 1.2 cm in greatest. dimension each (block 9-11, one node each) . A separate firm tan tumor mass involving the apex of the superior. segment, is 3.5 cm away from the bronchial resection margin and 2.5. cm from the hilar tumor. It is ovoid, 4.2 x 2 x 2.6 cm, firm,. tan-white and with elevated, well-defined margins. The tumor. appears to involve disrupted parenchyma beneath the suture line in. this area (frozen sections A2 and A3) . According to the surgeon,. this area corresponds to the area of lung parenchyma submitted for. frozen section examination with surface inked black. Apex tumor. blocks 12 and 13. Parenchyma away from these lesions displays. dilated bronchi, though many filled with pus and tan-pink parenchyma. without additional nodules (block 13) A portion of both tumors is. submitted as separate specimens for the. B. Labeled ""right middle lobe wedge, check area with stitch"" is a. 7.8 x 7.5 x 2.5 cm and 78 gram wedge of purple-tan lung with. generally smooth pleural surface and a Y-shaped heavy staple line. along one aspect. A stitch in the staple line denotes the area of. special attention, which is the bronchial margin and submitted for. frozen section evaluation. Next, additional section of this margin. is taken as block 2. According to the surgeon, this area. corresponds to the area of gross tumor at the apex of specimen ""A.'. No gross tumor is seen in this area or elsewhere within the rubbery. purple-tan parenchyma. Bronchi are opened and free of lesion. C. ""L9 lymph node.

Tumor 2. cm from bronchial resection margin. Diagnosis to Dr. A2. Parenchymal margin of apex tumor: Positive for carcinoma. B. Right middle lobectomy: Bronchial resection margin, negative for carcinoma. MICROSCOPIC. A. The frozen section control block confirms the frozen section. findings of a negative bronchial resection margin. The frozen. section control of the apex tumor confirms that is a nonsmall cell. carcinoma of high grade with foci of necrosis and apparent extensive. invasion of vascular channels, probably lymphatics. As noted grossly the large vein near the hilum and has infiltrating. carcinoma in its wall and the associated artery is negative. The. lymph node that is grossly involved near the hilum contains. metastatic high-grade carcinoma. The tumor focally has squamous. features and I do not see any small cell carcinoma, but part of the. larger tumor by the hilum does have some smaller cell size, but. appears to be a less mature form of squamous cell carcinoma. The. tumor in blocks 12 and 13 from the apex has larger cells and more. glassy cytoplasm and on H and E a question of additional. adenocarcinoma is raised. Out of all sampled lymph nodes we have four of six positive lymph. nodes. The tumor grows immediately beneath the pleural surface, but. does not present to the outer surface. Focal invasion into the. pleura is noted. Due to the multiple histologic morphologic variations in the tumors,. selected blocks A7 and A13 from the hilar and apical foci are. selected, respectively, for additional immunostains. P63 and CK 5,. squamous markers, are strongly positive in both tumor nodules. TTF-1, a good marker for adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinoma is. negative except for a few scattered cells. The stains were prepared. at. and the controls work. These results indicate. squamous cell carc√≠noma throughout both tumor nodules. B. The frozen section control confirms the frozen section findings. of a bronchial resection margin negative for tumor. Additional. tissue from this specimen is processed and all is negative for. invasive tumor. C. The lymph node is negative for tumor. D. The lymph node is reactive but is negative for metastatic. tumor. E. The lymph node is enlarged but is reactive, negative for. metastatic disease. DIAGNOSIS. A.

Pleura cloudy, lateral and dorsal adhesion residues and on the base, ventrobasal edge turned in a dorsal. direction. Whitish yellow discoloration of the pleura in a laterobasal area up to 5 cm in size, with relatively. clear demarcation at the edges. Bronchus displaced in the region of the B6/basal group branching, adjacent to. two partially lesioned grayish black nodes up to 1.8 cm and on the ventral side to a parenchymal flap enclosed. by a line of metal staple sutures 6 X 4 X 2 cm in size, apparently belonging to the lower lobe. Marker threads. inserted in the middle of the central area of the row of clips there. Discontinuation of B8 and 9 in a nodular. tumor with a largest extent of 4.2 cm extending from the central region to the periphery, with rather imprecise. borders and with a markedly arched edge in places. Pale grey, vitreous tumor tissue, slate grey pigmentation. towards the center, also irregularly circumscribed, eccentric cavity 8 mm in size. Extension of the tumor. towards the pleura in the area of the point of contact with the parenchymal flap described. As far as could be. detected no infiltration of the adjacent parenchymal flap. By the stretches of the root of 88 and 9 also large. vascular branches let into the tumor and apparently destroyed in places. Slight twisting of the stretches of the. root located in the tumor region of B10, this was otherwise clear as far as the periphery, like B6. Sections of B8. and 9 located peripherally of the tumor moderately widened, however, with whitish yellow material in the. lumens in places. Pulmonary tissue densities, especially laterally in the tumor border area, with speckled,. grayish brown section surfaces. A wedge-shaped area of induration of about the same size beneath the. laterobasal pleural changes described.

Microscopy. Description of the histological and cytological findings omitted for reasons of capacity. EVALUATION. Bronchopulmonary carcinoma of the left lower pulmonary lobe extending from the center to the periphery,. the center probably primary, histologically poorly or largely undifferentiated, large cell squamous cell. epithelial carcinoma with keratinization. Tumor manifestation in segments 8 and 9, where there was. surrounding and compression of the large pulmonary veins and incursion into and displacement of a branch of. the pulmonary artery. Peripheral incursion of the carcinoma into the pleura of the inter-lobar cleft and. minimal continuous progression into the jointly resected flap of pulmonary tissue from the upper lobe. (clinically: lingula), where the removal point was free of tumor. Large area of parenchymal necrosis in the. parts of the lower lobe behind that point in the nature of an infarction as a consequence of the disruption to. blood flow caused by the tumor with massive accumulation of siderophages in the border region and. accompanying fibrinous pleurisy that had already been smoldering for some time. Bronchus and vascular. displacement borders free of tumor, also the altogether rather slight deposition of anthracotic pigment. removed and lymph nodes showing reactive changes. No lymph nodes in sample 6), here pleural and. mediastinal tissue with soft adhesive strands and chronic inflammation. In the small fragment of pulmonary. tissue recorded under 3) a circumscribed focus of interstitial fibrosis or scarring with development of smooth. muscle. In sample 2) a rather larger, striated or wedge-shaped parenchymal scar of the pulmonary. parenchyma with atypical bronchiolo-alveolar or adenomatous cell proliferation at the edge. No or still no. coincident bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma. Therefore in accordance with the tumor formula provided pT2 pNO V1 RO, equivalent to stage IB. Morphology: 8070/3. Topography: C34.3.

Diffuse and nodular zones of sclerosis in lymph nodes. Slight, focally accentuated. chronic parietal pleuritis with short sections of reactive mesothelial proliferation and likewise short sections of. slight fibrosis (sample 4.)). Remark/addendum. The carcinoma has grown centrally as ar as the main bronchus and in peripheral regions shows areas of slight. invasion of the hypocellular fibrosed visceral pleura. It is therefore not possible to decide whether the. carcinoma has arisen in the periphery of the lung or in the center of the bronchial pathway. The lymph node. metastases, like the isolated invasions of small vessels, lie wthin the tumor or the bronchopulmonaary region. Apart from the main tumor, which has penetrated focally across the transverse pleural fissure into the adjacent. section of middle lobe, a separate small tumor focus has been detected in the middle lobe. This is classified as a. satellite nodule in another lobe, although histologically it hardly shows a squamous epithelial differentiation and. contains a small light-cell solid component. A tumor-associated high-grade inflammation is also found here. The etiology of the interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which shows only minimal process activity, is histologically. unclear: there may be an association with respiratory bronchiolitis.",TCGA-66-2742,LUSC

The resection margins of the large. pulmonary vessels and the bronchus resection line are tumor-free. The lymph node metastases lie in the region of the. primary tumor and the hilar region.

Primary diagnosis/diagnoses: Central bronchopulmonary, histologically largely undifferentiated, large-cell squamous cell carcinoma of the. right lower lobe of the lung (C4) with overgrowth of the interlobar fissure and continuous growth into the. adjacent section of the middle lobe and also several in some cases large lymph node metastases. Tumor. classification according to this picture pT2 pN3 L1 V1 R1, stage III. C34.3 M8070/3. Secondary diagnosis/diagnoses: Peripheral bronchiolectasia in the lower lobe, relatively large fibrous cicatricial remodeling zone in S10. mediobasal and similar flat subpleural cicatricial zones in S1 apical. Local high-grade pleural fibrosis over S10. Tumor-associated inflammation and small tumor necroses. Slight anthracotic pigment deposits in the lung. parenchyma and relatively marked in some lymph nodes. Remark/addendum: The main mass of the carc√≠noma lies in S10. Centrally it has grown as far as the bifurcations of the lower lobe. main bronchus and the middle lobe bronchus, without these being destroyed or constricted. The tumor invasion. of small blood vessels only concerns the focal region, the lymphangioinvasion is more marked and is also. located in the vicinity of the tumor focus. The R1 classification is based on the finding that carcinoma nests in. the large involved lymph nodes next to the bifurcation of the upper lobe bronchus extend to the mediastinal. resection plane. Further lymph node metastases are seen at the intermediate bronchus in the mediastinum and. also in the lymph nodes located under 4.) - 6.). The pN3 classification is also made with regard to the previous. finding with carcinoma cell structures in the fine needle aspiration biopsy from LN4 left (according to clinical. data).",TCGA-66-2791,LUSC

Numerous apoptoses, frequently at least five mitoses in a highly magnified viewing field. No inclusion of. mucin, instead intercellular bridges were repeatedly identified. In the center of solid tumor cell links,. degenerative changes in kariopyknoses and occasionally instances of cells showing dyskeratotic keratosis near. small and large areas of necrosis. Basic pulmonary tissue completely destroyed, development of fibrous. connective tissue moderately rich in cells with inclusion of inflammatory cells and vessels with thick walls,. some of which were filled with tumor cell links. Pleural border exceeded by tumor over a broad area in the. region of a lobar cleft, also incursion into the visceral pleura over a broad area, where the adhesive part of the. parietal pleura was free of tumor, only fibrotic. In addition here more pronounced chronic inflammatory cell. infiltrate. Towards the exterior including transversely striped muscle and intact rib bones with hematopoetic. cells of all kinds and to a lesser extent fat cells in the marrow cavity. In the small tumor focus also nests and. links of a solid, large cell tumor with characteristics of squamous cell epithelium structure, with here a short. stretch of replacement of original respiratory epithelium of a peripheral bronchus by atypical squamous cell. epithelium. Also destruction of the underlying pulmonary tissue, which was replaced by collagen and elastic. connective tissue, enclosed follicular lymphocyte aggregate and other inflammatory cells. Partially widened. airways in the pulmonary tissue free of tumor, slight deposition of anthracotic pigment in peribronchiolovasal. connective tissue and alveolar parenchyma with quite predominantly soft interstices. No evidence of tumor at. the displacement borders of the bronchus and large pulmonary vessels, respiratory mucosa normal. Lymph. nodes at the hilus with deposition of anthracotic pigment, accumulation of large macrophages and a few. secondary follicles. Adjacent lobes of the parietal pleura mainly entirely soft, only stretches of development of. slightly fibrotic connective tissue. Substantial adjacent fatty tissue in places. 2) - 11) Lymph nodes and parts of lymph nodes of various sizes with only occasional secondary follicles,. expansion of the paracortical or T zone, increase in capillary vessels in places, deposition of anthracotic pig-. ment of varying thicknesses and small focus of trabecular sclerosis. Small nerve stems and vessels of various. lumen sizes in the surrounding fatty tissue, including in sample 7) a small artery. 12) Fatty tissue in the shape of small lobes in places made up of single-vacuole fat cells, several enclosed. capillary vessels and narrow and broad bands of transversely striped muscle, which were also found in the. border areas. EVALUATION. Right upper pulmonary lobe with one large and one small focus of a poorly differentiated, large cell squamous. cell carcinoma not tending towards keratinization. The large tumor located in S2 and adjacent parts of. segment 3, extending from the center to the periphery, encroaching over the part of segment 6 or the middle. lobe removed and infiltrating the pleural over a broad area, is therefore probably primarily a peripheral. bronchopulmonary carcinoma with a satellite node in the lobe on the same side. The adhesive part of the. parietal pleura above the tumor was not infiltrated by the tumor, and the soft tissue and the resected part of. the ribs were also free of tumor. Partial necrotic alteration of the principal tumor, with vascular incursions in. this as well. Pulmonary parenchyma free of tumor largely normal, no hyaline plural plaque in the resected. pleura. Displacement borders of bronchus and large pulmonary vessels and all removed lymph nodes free of. tumor. An intramuscular lipoma in sample 12) without criteria for malignancy.

Additional comments: Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin CAM 5.2, TTF-1, and p63 were used in the. evaluation of this tumor. The tumor cells stained positively for CAM 5.2 and p63, and were negative for TTF-1. The fibrotic stroma within the tumor is negative for CAM 5.2. This supports the diagnosis of squamous cell. carcinoma. The squamous cell carcinoma is in association with a localized area of interstitial fibrosis wit hemosiderosis. and foci of organizing and recanalizing vascular thrombi. The fibrosis is localized to the subpleural region,. consistent with a pulmonary scar, that could be due to previous trauma or surgical procedure in this area. (patient' S history of prior cardiac surgery). In addition, the vascular changes present suggest that an old. scarring pulmonary infarct could be another possible etiology of the localized interstitial fibrosis.

Macroscopy: The specimen consists of a left lung which, in the inflated state, measures 200 mm in height X 165 x 60. mm. Fatty and fibrous adhesions are attached to the apex of the upper lobe where there is a scarred. area approximately 35 mm in diameter. The pleura is slightly roughened over the mediastinal aspect of. the upper lobe, approximately 50 mm in maximum dimension, under which a tumour is palpable. Fatty. tissue to a depth of 40 mm is present inferior to the bronchial resection margin and this contains. numerous lymph nodes which are small and black. Numerous large lymph nodes, which measure up to. 35 mm in maximum dimension, are present superior to the bronchial resection margin. On cut surfaces. the tumour is seen to be 55 mm in maximal dimension, poorly circumscribed, soft and grey and black,. but with a necrotic centre. It extends right up to the pleura on the hilar surface of the lung and also to. the pleura in the oblique fissure. The tumour appears to be arising from a segmental bronchus,. probably that of the apicoposterior bronchus of the upper lobe. It is well clear of the bronchial. resection margin. Uninvolved tissue between the tumour and the apex of the upper lobe is generally. indurated and that in the basal aspect of the lobe is collapsed. Large black lymph nodes are present. around major segmental bronchi in the lower lobe. No tumour is evident in the lower lobe and the. parenchyma is generally normal-appearing apart from an area approximately 10 mm in maximum. dimension towards the base which appears to be an area of haemorrhage.

Bronchial brushings showing. atypia suspicious for malignancy; bronchial washings negative.]. MACROSCOPIC. Three specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""left pneumonectomy"" and consists of a left lung. which measures 240 mm from the apex to the base, 165 mm from posterior to. anterior and up to 50 mm from lateral to medial. It weighs 343 g. The hilum. is distorted by a large tumour nodule which appears to involve both the apical. segment of the lower lobe and the superior lingular segment of the upper lobe. Mucopus protrudes from the bronchial resection margin and anteroinferior to. this margin there is a small firm nodule which may represent an involved lymph. node. The mediastinal pleural surface has a nodular appearance but elsewhere. the surface is smooth. Sectioning of the tumour reveals that it invades the. bronchial wall and projects within the lumen of the bronchus proximally towards. the margin. Tumour is present 11 mm from the bronchial resection margin. The. lesion measures 65 X 60 x 40 mm. The centre of the lesion is necrotic and. liquid but elsewhere the tumour has a firm variegated cut surface with areas of. cream, yellow and tan discolouration. The lesion abuts the overlying. mediastinal pleural surface. Extending from the tumour and into the lower lobe. there is an area of firm yellow discolouration which is demarcated along one. edge by interlobular septa. It extends over an area measuring 55 x 30 X 30 mm. and lies beneath the pleura along the anterior border of the lower lobe. This. area ends distally at a small 10 cm nodule which has a yellow focally. haemorrhagic cut surface. This nodule measures 12 mm in maximum extent. The. remaining lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable.

[Bisected, 2A.]. 3: The specimen is labelled ""No. 8 lymph node"" and consists of a single. fragment of fibrofatty tissue which measures 20 x 15 x 10 mm. Sectioning. reveals a blackened lymph node. [Bisected, 3A.]. MICROSCOPIC. 1: Sections show a non-small cell carcinoma with multifocal necrosis. The. majority of the tumour comprises patternless sheets of smallish cells with. granular chromatin and somewhat fibrillar or granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Page 1 o. Histopathology Report. In a few areas there is cytoplasmic clearing. There are scattered small foci. suggestive of squamous differentiation in the form of larger cells with more. eosinophilic cytoplasm, larger more vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli and. sometimes multinucleation. However there is no evidence of keratinisation and. no intercellular bridges are found. Mitoses are frequent and often abnormal. Immunoperoxidase staining for neuroendocrine markers (chromogranin,. synaptophysin and CD56) is negative. The tumour includes endobronchial and. parenchymal components. A tiny strip of metaplastic squamous epithelium. showing moderate dysplasia is noted in one large bronchus adjacent to the. tumour (1D), and several other airways within the tumour appear to show. squamous carcinoma in situ. Vascular invasion is identified (1D, 1E) and there. is invasion into, but not through, the mediastinal pleura (1E). Lymphatic. invasion is not identified but metastatic carcinoma is present in peribronchial. lymph nodes. No perineural invasion is seen. The bronchial resection margin. is clear of dysplasia and invasive malignancy, although a small amount of. largely necrotic tumour appears to lie free in the lumen. The inked. mediastinal soft tissue resection margin is also clear of malignancy. The. area. of yellowish consolidation in the lower lobe is the result of organising. obstructive pneumonitis. This shows focal cavitation resulting in the nodule. noted macroscopically, but no organisms are identified in routine or special. stains. 2 & 3: Sections of the separately submitted hilar and no. 8 lymph nodes show. reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and aggregates of pigmented histiocytes but no. evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

It holds a piece of tan-brown anthracotic lung. tissue measuring 2.5 x 1.8 X 0.3 cm. It is resubmitted entirely in cassette P1. Also received in the sixteenth container is a lung lobe without fixative, measuring 20.0 X 10.0 x 4.5. cm. The visceral pleura is mottled tan/purple and anthracotic/black. There is a mass measuring 4.0 x 3.5. X 3.5 cm at the apex of the lobe. The mass was previously cut for frozen section, and also previously to. that in the operating room after explant. The cut surface of tumor is tan and irregular, with solid and cystic. areas. The cystic areas are traversed by bands of tumor tissue. The mass appears to abut, but not. breach, the visceral pleura. Diffusely patchy areas surrounding the tumor are firmer to palpation than the. grossly uninvolved lung parenchyma. The staple line of the medial parenchymal resection margin is. removed and the cut surface inked black. The pleura over the tumor is inked blue. The tissue is then. serially sectioned to reveal the following: The primary tumor is 1.8 cm away from the nearest surgical. margin (medial parenchymal, black). It extends 3.0 cm deep into the lung tissue. It is well-circumscribed. but not encapsulated, with an irregular deep contour. There is an area of grainy tan-green/black tissue. 2.0 X 2.5 cm in maximum dimension lateral to the primary tumor. It too appears to touch but not breech. the overlying pleura. It appears dissimilar to the primary tumor, but still pathological compared to the. surrounding parenchyma. Similar foci of tan/green/black grainy tissue are scattered throughout the lung,. mostly inferiorly. None form discreet masses. The uninvolved parenchyma is a heterogeneous beefy. dark-red/anthracotic-black. One solid black perihilar lymph node is found. Representative sections are. submitted per the block summary.

It consists of a lobe of the lung measuring 15 x 12 x 8. cm and weighing 280 g. The pleural surface is pink-purple and smooth and shows multiple anthracotic markings. The bronchial and. vascular margins are stapled shut. The soft tissue margin of resection measuring 2 cm, 4 cm, 4.5 cm and 5 cm. A 1.3 x 1.2 x 1.2 cm an ill-defined gray-tan mass is identified 2 cm away from the bronchial margin of resection and 3 cm away from. the closest pleural surface. Pleural surface closest to the mass is covered with smooth surface without any papillary excrescences. and. is. inked. Remaining portion of the lung shows dark red tan congested parenchyma without other lesions. At the hilum 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.5. cm and 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm lymph nodes are identified. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 = bronchial and vascular margin of resection. A2 = soft tissue margin of resection. A3-A5 = mass, entirely submitted. A 6 = random section of the lung. A7 = 2 lymph nodes. A8 = closest pleural surface to the mass. B. The. specimen is labeled ""LEVEL VII"" and is received in formalin. It consists of 3 black tan lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 x 0.5 x. 0.3 - 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted in cassette B1. C. The. specimen is labeled ""LEVEL X"" and is received in formalin. It consists of 4 black tan lymph nodes measuring 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.2-. 0.8 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm. Entirely submitted in cassette C1. D. The. specimen is labeled ""RIGHT MIDDLE: LOBE"" and is received in formalin. It consists of a wedge shaped piece of lung tissue. measuring 3.5 x 1 x 0.7 cm which 3.5 cm stapled margin of resection. In the center portion 1 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm irregular fragmented area. is noted which is 0.3 cm away from the stapled margin of resection which is inked red. Entirely submitted in cassettes D1-D2. E. The specimen is labeled ""R4"" and is received in formalin. It consists of a single black lymph node measuring 2 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm. Sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette E1. F. The specimen is labeled ""R2"" and is received in formalin. It consists of a single black tan lymph node measuring 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.5. Print Date/Time: Collected Date/Time: Received Date/Time: cm. Sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette F1. Special Stains/Slides. TTF-1: negative in tumor cells. Napsin A: negative in tumor cells. p63: positive in tumor cells.
