The tumor margins are free of involvement, indicating successful resection. There is no evidence of lymphatic vascular invasion or extension into other structures. Lymph nodes from levels 7, 9R, 10R, and 11R were negative for malignancy. The TMN stage is pT2aNO. Non-neoplastic pathology includes post obstructive pneumonia. The intraoperative consultation confirmed adenocarcinoma with focal mucinous features, with bronchial margin negative for tumor.",TCGA-NJ-A4YP,LUAD
484,TCGA-NJ-A55O.FBB218E1-EB67-4C9D-8149-EE276C1E9BCE,"The patient underwent a right upper lobectomy due to an invasive adenocarcinoma, grade 1, with mucinous features, measuring 2.6 cm in the right upper lobe of the lung. All bronchial, vascular, parenchymal, and visceral pleural margins were free of tumor. However, one of five peribronchial lymph nodes was positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma, measuring 0.4 cm with no extracapsular extension. The remainder of the lung showed benign meningothelial-like rest. The tumor cells were strongly positive for CK7, positive for TTF-1, and negative for CK20 and CDX-2, supporting a lung primary. No tumor was found in the right paratracheal tissue and subcarinal lymph nodes. The final staging was pT1bN1 (PLO).",TCGA-NJ-A55O,LUAD
485,TCGA-NJ-A7XG.8EFDF414-12F3-4DF8-BB21-9E8876B727E8,"The patient underwent a pneumonectomy of the left lung, which revealed an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the upper lobe, measuring 10 cm, with extensive lymphovascular invasion extending into the parietal pleura. Multiple tumor nodules were identified in the left lower lobe. Metastatic carcinoma was found in 10 of 21 peribronchial lymph nodes. However, the margins of resection were free of malignancy. The tumor was staged as pT4N1. Additionally, three excised lymph nodes (Level 4R, AP window node level 5, and Level 6) were all negative for carcinoma. The bronchial and vascular margins were also negative for malignancy. The tumor infiltrates into the parietal pleura, indicating pleural invasion. The TMN stage is pT4N1.",TCGA-NJ-A7XG,LUAD
486,TCGA-O1-A52J.E5C54019-F404-4F8D-847A-80CF65F65E19,"The patient underwent a left lower lobe basilar segmentectomy, which revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with Clara cell features. Immunohistochemistry showed strong positive expression (3+) of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and negative (0) for overexpression of HER2/neu oncoprotein. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis showed an average EGFR copy number of 3.4 in tumor cells, with 95% of cells showing an increased copy number of the EGFR gene. The average chromosome 7 copy number was 5.2, with 95% of cells showing an increased copy number. The EGFR to chromosome 7 ratio was 1.11+/-0.35, with 74% of cells showing an increased ratio. The tumor was 2.6 cm in diameter, with negative margins and no evidence of vascular invasion or regional lymph node involvement. Additional findings included mild centrilobular emphysema and a small, focal non-necrotizing granuloma.",TCGA-O1-A52J,LUAD
487,TCGA-S2-AA1A.83A6F838-3F30-411F-9982-B8985C7FA52E,"The patient, a female, underwent a right upper lobe lobectomy and lymphadenectomy due to a pre-operative diagnosis of lung cancer. The post-operative diagnosis confirmed the presence of an invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe of the lung, measuring 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm. The tumor was well-differentiated (G1) and unifocal, with no identified visceral pleura invasion or lymph-vascular invasion. The bronchial, vascular, and parenchymal margins were uninvolved by the invasive carcinoma. No tumor was found in the 14 examined lymph nodes from various levels and the hilar region. Additionally, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia was noted. The tumor was classified as pT1b, indicating a tumor greater than 2 cm but 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus. The regional lymph nodes (pN) were classified as pN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis.",TCGA-S2-AA1A,LUAD
